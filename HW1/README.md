look at my issue to find my solutions to the homework and proof of completion

##### My completion of the learn git branching

I didn't know if i had to show it in my issue or in this file so I did both my bad, i couldn't clearly understand what to do 
but I finished all the levels:

 * Introduction
 * Ramping Up
 * Moving Around
 * Mixed Bag
 * Advanced

It was really *fun* and **useful** to learn thanks :)
